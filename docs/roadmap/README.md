# Delivery roadmap

Android container bring-up is being prepared using existing Waydroid ARM64
images and HWC. The [foundation implementation plan](../architecture/android-bringup.md)
records the source-audited Binder, shared-memory, boot, permissive/no-SELinux,
resource-pressure and device dependencies. This is planned work; Android boot
acceptance has not yet run.

The owner prioritized [Vulkan compute](../architecture/vulkan-compute.md) before
graphics/presentation and deferred host port forwarding. The first experimental
standard-loader/ICD path has actual native compute verification at 1/4 CPUs;
binary semaphore chains, preserved batch ordering, specialization constants and
partial/unaligned mapping now extend that verified subset.
Owned native pipeline compilation allows other guest threads to continue, and
direct page transfer removes the full-range upload/readback staging buffer.
Apple device/simulator builds link original MoltenVK; the exact runtime passes
all eleven simulator tests, including real Metal compute, rasterization and
visible preview (no skips). Physical iPad
acceptance remains for a grouped release.
Offscreen graphics now renders a vertex/fragment color triangle through native
images/render passes, with pixel readback and an iPad preview entry. Native and
1/4-CPU guest exports match; exact-source Metal/UI acceptance also passes.
[Rendering verification](../validation/vulkan-render.md) records this new scope.
Follow-up stages extend graphics resources and host-owned surfaces/swapchains.
[Issue #21](https://github.com/kb5000/trames/issues/21) and
[validation](../validation/vulkan-compute.md) track hardware acceptance and gaps.

Current development adds [worker-side NativeCall](../architecture/parallel-nativecalls.md)
after the [bulk native batch](../validation/bulk-native.md). Pure functions, parsers
and callback steps continue on their owning CPU through checked resident page
guards; kernel/live private backing effects still join. [Evidence and fixed-work
measurements](../validation/parallel-nativecalls.md) accompany issue #16.
The latest delivered device release is [0.16.0/build 17](../validation/release-0.16.md);
historical release and benchmark records below retain their original scope.

The current grouped release includes [host multicore execution](../architecture/multicore.md),
introduced before further shared-memory/native optimization. Persistent CPU workers
execute the same cached interpreter; syscalls/native/backing changes use joined
coordinator checkpoints. [Validation and measured limits](../validation/multicore.md)
cover ARM synchronization, musl pthreads and Node workers. The [0.12.0/build 13 delivery](../validation/release-0.12.md) provides the
verified unsigned IPA; the existing 0.11.0 delivery record remains immutable.

The next development follow-up introduces [continuous CPU workers](../validation/continuous-workers.md):
local instruction polls keep CPU/view ownership without returning to the coordinator;
kernel/native events and bounded timer/control/fairness checkpoints still join all CPUs.
The preserved 0.12.0 IPA is unchanged. Tracker: [#13](https://github.com/kb5000/trames/issues/13).

The current verified release is [0.12.0 multicore](../validation/release-0.12.md),
building on [0.11.0 accelerator, interpreter memory and Node.js](../validation/release-0.11.md),
with one Rust cached interpreter, static ARM64 compute and recoverable guest CPU faults.
The C++ executor and tail-dispatch prototype have been removed.
The [Node.js and memory follow-up](../architecture/nodejs-memory.md) adds sparse
PROT_NONE reservations, canonical argv/env packing, standard-stream nonblocking
behavior and selected TCP keepalive options. Signed Node.js/npm workflows join
Linux CI; interpreter memory cost has a reproducible old/new benchmark.
The [source follow-up](../validation/compatibility-log.md) adds bounded runtime
logs and selected file syscalls; [shared mapping/ABI work](../validation/mmap-coverage.md)
adds coherent mappings, memfd and further file/scheduler entries included in 0.9.0. The canonical
[current CPU/Linux gaps](compatibility-current.md) links regenerated instruction
and Linux v6.12 syscall inventories, distinguishing missing entries from partial semantics.
[M6 compatibility](compatibility-m6.md) records the implemented Linux ABI subsets.
The [0.3 release](compatibility-gaps.md), [pre-implementation worktree](compatibility-gaps-worktree.md),
[0.4 profile](compatibility-0.4.md) and [0.7 performance](../validation/nonjit-0.7.md)
remain historical evidence for their own revisions.

The owner-provided [Trames Accelerator RFC](../architecture/accelerator.md) describes
guest library stubs and precompiled native backends. Development now includes the
[NativeCall v1 pure profile](../architecture/accelerator-v1.md), the initial bounded
transport and five functions from phases A/B. Stateful libc, GPU/video/ML and JIT
remain proposed. Version 0.10.0/build 11 integrates the full shared musl ELF and
activates the pure profile in the iPad application.
The subsequent [musl optimization queue](musl-optimization.md) records direct
guest-page access, ten adapted functions, capability negotiation and the next
pure/stateful candidates. [Guest callbacks and native sorting](../architecture/native-callbacks.md) add nested resumable qsort/qsort_r and experimental bsearch. Version 0.11.0/build 12 groups these improvements into one unsigned Sideloadly update; physical acceptance remains in issue #8.

M0, the selected static-userspace M1 foundation, M2 ash/FP, the storage follow-up and M3 are implemented, with records
in [m0.md](../validation/m0.md), [m1.md](../validation/m1.md), [m2.md](../validation/m2.md), [storage.md](../validation/storage.md) and [network.md](../validation/network.md) and [m3.md](../validation/m3.md). This does not
establish general Linux userspace compatibility. M4's software and unsigned
Apple builds are validated in [m4.md](../validation/m4.md). The owner confirmed
Windows/Sideloadly signing, installation and startup on a physical iPad on
2026-10-11; the remaining device checklist is still open.

The owner requested on 2026-10-11 that future feature changes be grouped into a
larger release, with M5 explained before implementation. Keep the app's bundle
identifier stable across updates; internal CI builds do not require a new device
installation. The terminal viewport fix will also be included in that release.
Version 0.2.0/build 3 delivered Linux compatibility and the viewport fix. The
0.3.0/build 4 follow-up implements M5 with package-creation fixes and an explicit
Linux reset. Software verification is recorded in [M5](../validation/m5.md).

M3 is validated with unmodified Alpine binaries, a deterministic native HTTPS
peer and upstream Alpine-signed index/packages. The subsequent virtual network
is validated in [virtual-network.md](../validation/virtual-network.md).

The implemented virtual network reserves 10.0.0.1 for the
gateway/DNS and assigns environments 10.0.0.2, 10.0.0.3, etc. Internal addressing
and service ports are independent of native interfaces. A bounded userspace
packet stack handles internal protocols; native TCP/UDP supplies Internet egress
within host policy. No host route changes or VPN entitlement are required.

The Linux CLI now defaults to a disk-backed store, with an initial 16 GiB logical
budget and capacity snapshots. VolumeSpace and stream APIs now supply the iPad
frontend's capacity display and coordinated, security-scoped Files copies.
M5 adds persistent provider bookmarks; selected resources are not live guest mounts.
M6 permits 512 MiB mapped per process and 1 GiB across address spaces for LLVM
and compiler subprocesses. Installing a package is not proof that its programs can execute.

Repository policy clarification: the original charter proposed confirming private
visibility. During kickoff the owner explicitly selected public `kb5000/trames`,
overriding that proposal, and requested a GNU license. The initial concrete
license choice is GPL-3.0-or-later. License compatibility is reviewed separately
for each future dependency.

Version 0.10.0 integrates a [complete hybrid musl](../architecture/musl-hybrid.md) built from the pinned
original source, installed at normal libc/loader filenames. Adapted pure functions
use NativeCall; the remaining original libc/loader functions keep running as guest
code. The separate pure-profile library remains the initial validation tool.
Stateful allocator, TLS and I/O profiles follow after the full ELF integration.

Version 0.13.0/build 14 packages [continuous CPU workers](../validation/continuous-workers.md)
and poll deadline cleanup. [IPA and exact-source verification](../validation/release-0.13.md)
retain the previous release history; physical iPad performance remains pending.
