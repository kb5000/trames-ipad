# Native Wayland compositor

Original ARM64 Linux clients use their ordinary libwayland and connect to a host
Rust compositor built from wayland-rs and upstream protocol definitions. There
is no nested guest Weston compositor. Each xdg_toplevel becomes an independently
managed iPad window: move, resize, minimize, close or maximize into a workspace
tab. Resizing sends configure/ack and requires new client buffer dimensions;
it does not retain and scale a fixed-resolution canvas.

The unreleased [Xwayland adapter](xwayland.md) adds original guest X11 servers
with native XWM and independent workspace windows, initially through SHM.

The implementation is tracked by [PR #26](https://github.com/kb5000/trames/pull/26)
and [Issue #25](https://github.com/kb5000/trames/issues/25). It is released in
0.17.0; publication and artifact verification are tracked in the
[release record](../validation/release-0.17.md). See the [usage guide](../guides/wayland.md).

## Shared storage and descriptors

Managed guest memfds have a real anonymous host inode. The Unix stream bridge
carries bounded control messages and SCM_RIGHTS capabilities, never pixels or
host paths. Connection identity comes from the guest bridge. Virtual descriptor
identity, credentials, logical EOF/seals, mmap dirty/COW hooks and existing guest
memory synchronization are preserved. The shared physical-storage budget is
128 MiB per instance for mapped, written or explicitly reserved shared ranges.
Sparse memfd logical length is separately bounded at 2 GiB; ftruncate does not
charge untouched holes. Logical shrink retains live mappings, zeroes removed
bytes and uses host sparse-hole clearing where supported. Guest KEEP_SIZE
allocation reserves ranges without growing EOF; guest hole punching remains
unsupported, so original foot uses its existing non-scrolling-SHM fallback.

An export lease is registered before sending SCM_RIGHTS and survives until
SharedFile import acknowledges the descriptor or its client disconnects. Closing
the last guest descriptor while an FD is in transit therefore cannot lose its
logical EOF, managed backing or budget. Cancelled transfers cannot consume the
acknowledgement for a later export of the same inode. Backpressure is bounded
independently of frame leases.

Mappings retain storage independently of descriptors. Logical shrinking zeros
removed bytes without physically truncating pages still visible to native readers
or GPU work. Physical storage remains charged until the final mapping/frame lease
is released. A wl_buffer shared across surfaces has one common usage lease.

The Metal frontend imports page-aligned SHM bytes with bytesNoCopy and handles
arbitrary row strides in its fragment shader. A refused import uses an explicit,
counted copy fallback. Frames retain their bytes through Metal command completion
and remain valid across VM shutdown. Mode-zero fallocate reserves guest storage
quota and grows files while preserving data and file position. KEEP_SIZE,
hole-punching and physical host-block reservation are not implemented.

## Vulkan presentation

Frame callback pacing follows the same nominal refresh period advertised by
`wl_output`. A frontend polling faster than the display cannot create a faster
callback feedback loop. Only commits acknowledged by an actual presentation are
eligible; delayed callbacks coalesce at the next deadline, without acknowledging
newer, undisplayed commits. The native server wakes for that deadline even if the
UI has paused redrawing an unchanged image. Timestamps retain the frontend epoch
and wrap as Wayland's 32-bit milliseconds require. GPU FIFO acknowledgement and
buffer/texture lease release remain independent of callback pacing.

Standard VK_KHR_wayland_surface uses the original guest loader/libwayland. The
ICD resolves libwayland through its own handle, including clients using RTLD_LOCAL.
It authenticates the bridged connection and resolves its connection-local
wl_surface ID; guest pointers never become host capabilities.

Swapchains own bounded pools of original native Vulkan optimal images. On Apple,
VK_EXT_metal_objects exports their MTLTextures for direct Metal sampling. Producer
fences gate publication without blocking the VM coordinator. A frame lease spans
producer completion, queued/current scenes and final Metal command completion.
Image reuse follows the final lease, including swapchain replacement and session
teardown. FIFO waits for UI presentation; Mailbox replaces queued Mailbox frames
and may publish a newer ready image before the previous frame is displayed.
Cancellation releases only the queue lease, retaining producer and acquired UI
leases until completion. Both modes are bounded across pool replacement; allocations share the existing 128 MiB GPU budget.

Normal presentation performs no pixel readback or GPU-to-CPU-to-GPU transport.
Only debug acceptance reads back the final host drawable for pixel verification.
CPU mappings remain separate guest/native storage: native HOST_COHERENT types
synchronize changed bytes at submit, successful fence status/wait and unmap,
preserving independent CPU/GPU changes. Those shadow transfers are distinct from
image presentation. See [Vulkan memory and lifetime](vulkan-compute.md#memory-and-lifetime)
for the profile's boundaries and accounting.

The graphics subset includes sRGB textures, D16/D32 depth attachments, native sampler anisotropy
(queried and enabled from the host feature/limit), transfer color clears, static/dynamic viewport and scissor, native color/alpha
blending, depth
compare/write, empty native pipeline caches, PREINITIALIZED images and
SIMULTANEOUS_USE command buffers with per-submission completion accounting.
The App no longer mounts the legacy fixed-display monitor. The native embedding
API retains it only for regression tests. Native Wayland and legacy fixed-display
WSI remain separate instance routes;
requesting both on one instance is rejected.

## Workspace and focus

Terminal and Wayland identities share one root tab/window model, independent of
mutable application titles. Tabs can reorder or detach; an explicit floating-window
button docks into that same tab row. Dragging to the top does not maximize.
Minimization preserves window identity and leaves an inactive tab for restoration.
Client toplevel parent/min/max hints are exposed separately from popup scene parenting.
Fixed-size transient dialogs use their committed client size plus the host header,
and configure requests respect their limits.
Geometry comes from the actual header/content frames. Resizing follows available
client space. Guest mode acknowledgements do not steal terminal focus on every
frame, and empty OSC titles fall back to the session's original title.

Selected background tab and keyboard focus are separate. Focusing a floating
window does not remove the selected terminal; touching the terminal clears the
Wayland seat and reclaims UIKit first responder. Canvas/frame updates only change
first responder when the desired focus changes. v1 activation sends one balanced
leave/enter across widget switches and ignores duplicate activation; epochs
invalidate composition belonging to an old widget.

The only terminal host stays mounted when all windows are minimized. Keyboard
focus is resigned before publishing a hidden layout; queued UIKit focus requests
are revision-checked and applied outside SwiftUI updates. Hidden terminals cannot
become first responder, and ordinary redraws preserve manual keyboard dismissal.

## Clipboard and GTK

The 0.18.0/build 21 test app adds wl_data_device_manager v3, data sources and
selection offers. Original GTK3 waits for this global, in addition to the
compositor, before creating its default seat. Omitting it caused mousepad's
GDK_IS_SEAT errors. Selection delivery follows the focused client and passes
clipboard pipe FDs with SCM_RIGHTS. Coordinator-owned, nonblocking relays move
bounded byte chunks between virtual guest pipes and native pipe descriptors;
guest Rc/RefCell state never crosses onto native threads.

Guest-to-guest offers retain the source's MIME types and use the normal source
send/receive flow. The host provider supports UTF-8 text up to the existing
16 KiB Bridge limit, with at most four off-thread transfers. It advertises text
without reading UIPasteboard; actual reads occur only when a client requests
the offered data. Pasteboard-change notifications and foreground entry replace
old selections without inspecting their contents. New text writes and host
clipboard changes invalidate older pending writes. Deadlines, session teardown
and closed pipe readers terminate pending transfers.

Clipboard Bridge calls execute automatically under the owner-selected policy.
iPadOS owns read permission prompts; writes have no OS permission dialog. The
global Native Bridge setting rejects new host requests when disabled. Other
native capabilities retain their existing consent flow. UIKit copy/cut/paste/
select-all actions send guest control keys so the original toolkit owns the
selection and transfer. Image clipboard and drag-and-drop remain unsupported.
Original host GTK3 and mousepad pass real seat/window tests and Unicode
clipboard transfers. Build 24 additionally exercises the original GTK text
context menu and signed ARM64 mousepad through the production guest FD and
Bridge adapters: Ctrl+C, right-click Copy, then navigation and a Chinese text
commit after the popup closes. GTK destroys its menu before sending selection;
unmapping/destroying/dismissing a focused popup restores the nearest mapped
parent so keyboard, text-input and data-device focus agree. A grabbed menu that
has not attached a buffer, or has detached it before destruction, cannot take
focus back from that parent. Keyboard-triggered
menus also accept GTK's recent key-release grab serial, while retaining the
client and popup-parent checks.

On iPad, printable hardware keys keep using the native input method. Navigation,
editing and function keys use guest key events even when UIKit represents them
as printable private-use Unicode: moving only the local document mirror would
leave its selection inconsistent with the guest cursor. ISO/keypad keycodes and
shifted ASCII punctuation in the no-text-input fallback are mapped explicitly.
Each physical raw key sends one down/up pair; UIKit duplicate downs are consumed
because the Wayland client already implements repeat using `repeat_info`.

Before handing a host text receive to the asynchronous clipboard provider, the
compositor releases held keys, preserving Caps Lock, the selection offer, popup
state and keyboard/text-input focus. An iPadOS paste-permission alert can take
physical key-up delivery away from UIKit. Without this handoff GTK keeps
repeating Ctrl+V while the provider waits, then applies all pending paste actions
to the same cached text: one host read can produce dozens of insertions. An
original GTK3 regression delays the provider for two seconds with no physical
release, verifies one insertion and unchanged focus, then accepts a late release
and a new intentional paste. Guest-to-guest FD transfers retain their existing
path. See the [build 25 record](../validation/ipad-0.18-build25.json).

The simulator exercises automatic guest clipboard requests against the real
UIPasteboard; OS permission presentation and physical-keyboard behavior still
need iPad acceptance. See the [build 24 record](../validation/ipad-0.18-build24.json)
and the earlier [build 21 record](../validation/ipad-0.18-build21.json).

## Scene and input

Synchronized subsurfaces publish buffers/positions atomically with their parent.
Input regions retain copy semantics. Buffer scale/transform, window-geometry
origins and nonzero v4 attach offsets are preserved. Popup placement supports
anchor/gravity and ordered flip/slide/resize constraints, explicit reposition
tokens, authenticated implicit grabs and outside-click dismissal. Surface role
identity survives role-object destruction.

The native canvas includes popup extents beyond root geometry, clipped to the
actual workspace before drawable allocation. Empty padding is transparent and
does not intercept neighboring controls. Pointer/caret coordinates include that
scene origin. Pointer grabs deliver release outside the originally pressed region;
native focus loss clears held keys/buttons and stale text contexts.

A native seat sends Linux evdev keycodes. The original xkeyboard-config US keymap
is protocol data; native composition uses UIKit UITextInput and text-input v1/v3.
The local document uses UTF-16 and converts to protocol UTF-8 byte offsets for
preedit, commit, deletion and cursor ranges. Context IDs/epochs reject late edits
after focus changes. Surrounding text and caret rectangles return from the client.
Weston editor uses v1; an independent original C client exercises v3.

v3 surrounding deletion excludes selected text; preedit/commit replaces the
selection itself. UIKit avoids duplicate deletion and retains selection direction.
v1 preserves explicit cursor-relative byte deletion. Marked-text backspace acts
at the composition caret, including interior selections.

## Validation

- 138 affected shared/VFS/Vulkan/FFI/Wayland library tests, six portable workspace
  tests, the Rust iOS target check and strict Clippy pass on Linux.
- Five independent original C acceptance groups cover two-window resize/close,
  synchronized scenes/popups/input regions/grabs, v3 UTF-8/serial/surrounding state,
  exclusive v1 widget activation, producer readiness/FIFO/Mailbox/budget and
  retained GPU-image lifetime.
- Original Alpine-signed wayland-info, Weston SHM/editor, vkcube and vkmark run through
  the production session/transfer/frame ABI. vkcube recreates images at 320x240.
  Retained SHM/GPU capabilities survive session shutdown and then release cleanly.
  All 13 default vkmark scene variants pass in short functional runs; scene
  exceptions are failures even when vkmark itself exits zero.
- Compute (including coherent unmap/remap and persistent mappings without explicit
  flush/invalidate), graphics and texture outputs match the independent native
  Linux driver with one and four guest CPUs; graphics pixels match byte-for-byte.
- Both Apple apps link. Actual Apple simulator execution passes original
  wayland-info, two-window resize, no-copy SHM drawing and Weston widget A/B/A
  Chinese/emoji composition. vkcube reaches Metal drawables at a recreated
  320x240 extent; original vkmark runs clear, anisotropic texture and Phong scenes.
  Anisotropy/transfer-clear and static alpha-blend pixel tests pass on the native
  GPU. Workspace gestures and repeated UIKit terminal focus are exercised.
  Current acceptance is 33 passed, zero failed/skipped; see the
  [workspace/vkmark record](../validation/wayland-workspace-vkmark.md). This is
  simulator execution, not a physical iPad test. The earlier 23-test record
  remains historical in [initial acceptance](../validation/wayland-native.md).

Reproduce independent native C acceptance with the original development tools:

```sh
bash scripts/test-wayland.sh
```

On Apple, that script builds original Wayland 1.23.1 client/scanner sources with
a documented Darwin OS adapter: fcntl CLOEXEC, SO_NOSIGPIPE, getpeereid, original
recvmsg CLOEXEC fallback and omission of unused server epoll helpers. Protocol,
queue and marshalling sources stay unchanged; this test library is not linked
into the app. Linux uses the original distro library.

To prepare signed offline inputs and exercise the production ABI on Linux:

```sh
bash scripts/build-vulkan-fixtures.sh
python3 scripts/prepare-wayland-guest.py
cargo build -p trames-ffi --release --locked
TRAMES_WAYLAND_STORE=/tmp/trames-wayland-test python3 tests/integration/wayland.py --prepare
TRAMES_WAYLAND_STORE=/tmp/trames-wayland-test python3 tests/integration/vkmark-wayland.py
```

The store must be absent for --prepare. Omit that flag to repeat client/lifetime
checks against a prepared store. Ordinary guest apk resolves and verifies the
original repository, choosing between alternative providers itself. Weston CSD
PNG assets come from Alpine's `weston` package; `weston-clients` alone lacks them.
The headless ABI test does not validate Apple pixels or system keyboard behavior.
Apple CI uses these same original inputs against real CAMetalLayer drawables,
UIKit input and native configure-driven image recreation.

## Host density and viewport geometry (2026-11-11)

Frontends publish the host window's integer backing density through the existing
output-scale command. Logical window sizes and pointer positions do not change.
Virtual density outputs have distinct logical origins: overlapping `(0,0)` output
keys caused Firefox's monitor lookup to combine the 2x monitor with the 1x mode
and infer a false fractional scale of one.

The shared compositor also implements standard `wp_viewporter` source cropping,
destination scaling, reset/destruction and double-buffered state, including
synchronized subsurfaces. Crop coordinates follow buffer transform and buffer
scale. Protocol values and buffer extents are checked when the state is applied;
normal pixel access and guest byte visibility gain no extra checks or barriers.
The [viewport protocol](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland-protocols/-/blob/1.43/stable/viewporter/viewporter.xml)
defines these coordinate and lifetime rules.

Firefox 151.0.3 needs viewporter even for its integer/ceiled content-surface scale
path. Without it, GTK's toplevel reached scale two while Firefox's own EGL child
fell back to monitor zero and rendered at scale one. The matching
[upstream implementation](https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-release/file/2d490a949ec649b79bfdecbc07b7531472dc41a0/widget/gtk/WaylandSurface.cpp#l769)
requires a viewport in `EnableCeiledScaleLocked`; no forced browser DPI setting
or Firefox patch is needed after providing that protocol.

Committed scene images carry the logical destination and normalized transformed
source rectangle. Mac and iPad Metal shaders draw the original SHM/GPU capability
with those coordinates; no resized intermediate image, readback, new lock or
service thread is introduced. iPad PiP uses the same crop metadata. Native FFI
image v1 stays 64 bytes; v2 returns its separate 24-byte geometry record in the
same frame lookup. Old ABI callers must opt into v2 to display viewport content.

Original libwayland C regressions cover independent output identities, 1x/2x
transitions, source crop, 90-degree transform, destruction/reset, and malformed
source/destination/lifetime requests. Mac Firefox acceptance additionally checks
DPR=2 at browser zoom 1 with the default DPI preference, actual 3840x1856 EGL
pixels for a 1920x928 logical window, and native mouse/keyboard coordinates.

## Initial limits and upstream notices

This is a selected protocol/graphics implementation, not full Wayland or Vulkan
conformance. Output scale starts at one until the frontend publishes host density.
Virtual output geometry is synthetic, not a complete physical-monitor layout;
fractional output density is not advertised. Image clipboard, DnD, custom
cursor images, automatic reactive popup relayout, touch protocol and EGL/OpenGL
bridging are not implemented. Device touch and actual system keyboard experience
still require iPad use.

wayland-backend is vendored under its original MIT license with three documented
Apple cfg changes. See its TRAMES-PATCHES.md and the [dependency record](../security/dependencies.md#native-wayland-and-shared-descriptors).
Original dependency, XML and keymap notices are bundled in the App. The offline
Wayland repository/client fixtures serve DEBUG XCTest acceptance and are omitted
from sideload IPA packaging; runtime clients are installed with ordinary apk.


## Native activation and popup coordinates (2026-11-14)

Native focus notifications identify a containing toplevel. AppKit can repeat
that activation when a popup overlay becomes key and before a button release.
Within the currently active surface tree, these notifications preserve popup
focus, held keys and pointer grabs. Real toplevel changes and native focus loss
still dismiss menus; focus loss also releases held buttons.

Pointer delivery and keyboard activation are separate. Non-grabbing panels,
including Firefox's hamburger menu, receive pointer events while keyboard focus
stays on their containing toplevel. An explicit popup grab can own keyboard
focus. Rendering subsurfaces do not become independent keyboard windows just
because they receive a pointer hit. The old behavior sent keyboard leave on
Firefox's main surface during a menu press, causing the client to destroy the
panel before release. The failed-before regression and original C client cover
both the non-grabbing and explicitly grabbed paths.

Positioners use each parent window's logical geometry, independently of buffer
pixel scale. A native presenter can supply its available workspace relative to
each toplevel. Mac converts `NSScreen.visibleFrame` through the window and flipped
canvas, updating it on resize, movement and screen changes. Popup creation and
reposition translate these bounds into a nested parent's coordinates. Before
host metadata arrives, fallback bounds at least include the actual toplevel size.
This common implementation remains iPad-compatible and adds no service thread.

The actual Firefox trace demonstrated why the bootstrap viewport is insufficient:
a 340x681 menu anchored at (1876,52,40,24) in a 1920x928 window was constrained
against 1024x768 and moved to x=684. It now receives
`xdg_popup.configure(1576,76,340,681)`, under the hamburger button.

All 27 Wayland unit tests and six original C-client cases pass, including wide
menu creation/reposition, nested bounds, complete clicks and outside dismissal.
Strict shared/Mac Clippy, paired iOS FFI compilation, Mac release builds and
architecture guards pass. The owner confirmed real mouse input opens Settings
and Manage certificates in Dev. Both Mac channels are updated, and the original
Stable Debian business container restored healthy. The earlier generic native
frame test was occluded and is recorded separately from that owner-observed
acceptance; it is not reported as a pass. See the [Mac acceptance record](https://github.com/kb5000/trames-mac/blob/main/docs/validation/mac-firefox-dialogs-20261114.json).
